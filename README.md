What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	Spotify DJ is an app to see what other people are listening to right now! Basically the main
	page shows the last 100 songs that were listened to on spotify DJ by any other people who 
	used the application. You can listen to these songs all you want. You can also search for
	new music and listen to anything that is on spotify right from Spotify DJ. This could get
	annoying if people were playing new songs 1,000 times a second but luckily I'm not getting
	that kind of traffic. I would change the way it worked if I was doing this on a larger scale
	Note, you can only search for music by artist (sorry, I had time constraints)

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
	
	http://students.washington.edu/jhand1/info343/spotifydj

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

	I got some css to make an image grid from this URL:

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

	Probably 15ish but that is because I originally wanted to make it so you could "subscribe"
	to people and listen to whatever they are listening to (basically making your friend's
	music slection into your own personal radio station). Unfortunately I couldn't really make
	this happen given the time constraints. Major issues that arose were the fact that you can
	only do 30 second samples of songs with the spotify api and limitations to being able to 
	tell how far somebody is into a song and transmit that to other clients.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

	Basically just be careful of getting too ambitious. Although I think it was a good learning
	experience to figure out to do when faced with time/technical limitations
