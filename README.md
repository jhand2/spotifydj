What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	Spotify DJ is an app to see what other people are listening to right now! Basically the main page shows the last 100 songs
	that were listened to on spotify DJ. You can listen to these songs all you want. You can also search for new music and listen to anything that is on spotify right from Spotify DJ. Note, you can only search for music by artist (sorry, I had time constraints)
